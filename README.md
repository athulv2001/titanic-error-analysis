Error analysis and bias exploration of a Titanic survival classifier

# Titanic Survival Prediction – Error Analysis

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze the errors made by a machine learning model that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic. Instead of focusing only on accuracy, this project emphasizes understanding where and why the model fails.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the classic Titanic passenger dataset, which contains demographic and ticket-related information such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and survival status.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to perform error analysis and identify potential bias in model predictions across different passenger groups.

## Methodology
A simple classification model is trained to predict survival outcomes. Model performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, with particular attention to false positives and false negatives. Error patterns are analyzed across passenger groups such as gender and ticket class.

## Key Insights
This section will summarize the main findings from the error analysis, including observed bias patterns and limitations of the model.
